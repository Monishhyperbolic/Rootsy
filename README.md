# Rootsy: Empowering Rural India



Rootsy is a web-based marketplace designed to empower rural Indian farmers, artisans, and microentrepreneurs by connecting them directly to urban consumers. Inspired by the vibrant landscapes of Ooty, Rootsy fosters fair trade, cultural preservation, and sustainable growth, aiming to increase rural incomes by 40% (from ₹80,000 to ₹1,12,000/year). With AI-driven customer support and blockchain-based payments, Rootsy aligns with UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) 1, 5, 8, 10, and 12. Currently in the planning and prototyping stage, Rootsy is being developed by Monish Patil as a solo project for Rural Innovation.


# Project Overview

Rootsy addresses the challenges faced by rural Indian producers, such as limited market access, middlemen exploitation (40–60% profit cuts), and digital exclusion. By providing a web-based platform, Rootsy enables farmers to sell organic produce (e.g., Nilgiri tea, Ooty vegetables) and artisans to showcase handicrafts (e.g., Toda shawls, pottery). The platform uses AI for customer support, blockchain payments for transparency, and a vibrant, Ooty-inspired design to celebrate rural heritage. Rootsy targets 5,000 sellers in its first year, with plans for AI product matching and a mobile app.
